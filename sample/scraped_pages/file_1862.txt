B.Laban, a fast-growing dairy and dessert chain with branches in nine Arab countries, was the talk of the town last month. The saga started with the closure of a number of its branches in Saudi Arabia due to food poisoning claims. This was followed by the Egyptian authorities’ decision to close some branches after finding harmful bacteria in samples of its products. The authorities then closed all their outlets and the owners submitted a petition to Egypt’s president to help save the 25,000 employees who work for the company. Before the closure of the outlets, the Ministry of Health had conducted 232 inspection visits to B.Laban-affiliated facilities, during which 437 samples were taken — several of which failed to meet Egyptian quality standards. Authorities reported the discovery of expired ingredients and unidentified food sources. A total of 697 kilogrammes of various food items and 70 litres of beverages were destroyed due to spoilage, and 387 violations were documented. The inspections also revealed that 122 of the company’s facilities lacked proper licensing. The ministry said that its oversight efforts were part of a broader preventive health campaign coordinated between the food inspection division and the National Food Safety Authority (NFSA). According to the ministry’s statement, a meeting had taken place on 6 April between NFSA leadership and a B.Laban representative. The company had been informed during that meeting of the necessary procedural corrections at that time but had failed to act. On 18 April the NFSA issued an official statement confirming the presence of pathogenic bacteria in samples taken from B.Laban products. The authority said the bacteria posed a serious risk to consumer health and is among the leading causes of food poisoning. The statement also highlighted the use of internationally banned artificial colours and poor storage practices that led to product spoilage and chemical alterations. In its report, the NFSA disclosed that more than 47 outlets linked to B.Laban and its affiliated chains were visited during inspection campaigns. As a result, enforcement measures were taken, including the temporary suspension of business activities, confiscation of substandard products, and destruction of items unfit for human consumption. The authority stressed the urgency of correcting the violations before operations could resume. One day later, B.Laban’s 110 branches and production facilities in Egypt were closed including Karam Al-Sham, Konafa & Basbousa, Wahmy Burger, and Aam Shaltat. The company urged President Abdel-Fattah Al-Sisi to intervene, citing the impact on its 25,000 employees and its position in the Arab region. B.Laban referred to itself as a nationally-grown brand that had achieved significant success in the regional food and beverage market. On 21 April a meeting was held between officials from the NFSA, the Ministry of Health, veterinary and supply agencies, local municipalities, and representatives of B.Laban and its affiliated chains. According to statements made by one of the company’s owners, Abdel-Rahman Ashmawi, the eight-hour meeting reviewed all administrative and health-related aspects of the violations that led to the temporary closure of 110 outlets across Egypt. The parties reportedly reached an agreement with the company to implement a series of corrective measures within five days, according to the Cairo24 news channel. These included both health and administrative requirements such as eliminating unauthorised food additives and aligning the construction standards of kitchens and factories with national regulations. The NFSA mandated in particular the removal of certain artificial colourings and adherence to proper waste disposal and ventilation systems. Additionally, municipal representatives required the company to license any unregistered outlets and resolve outstanding documentation issues. Ashmawi noted that the requirements were manageable and that officials were cooperative, offering a path to resume operations upon verification of compliance. On Monday, B.Laban announced that Saudi authorities had approved the reopening of its branches in the kingdom, its first international expansion hub in the Gulf. * A version of this article appears in print in the 24 April, 2025 edition of Al-Ahram Weekly Follow us on: Facebook Instagram Whatsapp Short link: Latest News CAF U20 Africa Cup of Nations fixtures (1st round, group stage) Live score: Egypt v South Africa (CAF U-20 Africa Cup of Nations) Egyptian film Life After Siham to screen at Cannes parallel section ACID Italy Serie A fixtures & results (34th matchday) Egyptian actresses May El-Ghety, May Calamawy join cast of new US production.....
