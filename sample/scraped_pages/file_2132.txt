Over 20 million copies sold! Translated into 60+ languages! Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results No matter your goals, Atomic Habits offers a proven framework for improving--every day. James Clear, one of the world's leading experts on habit formation, reveals practical strategies that will teach you exactly how to form good habits, break bad ones, and master the tiny behaviors that lead to remarkable results. If you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. Here, you'll get a proven system that can take you to new heights. Clear is known for his ability to distill complex topics into simple behaviors that can be easily applied to daily life and work. Here, he draws on the most proven ideas from biology, psychology, and neuroscience to create an easy-to-understand guide for making good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible. Along the way, readers will be inspired and entertained with true stories from Olympic gold medalists, award-winning artists, business leaders, life-saving physicians, and star comedians who have used the science of small habits to master their craft and vault to the top of their field. Learn how to: make time for new habits (even when life gets crazy); overcome a lack of motivation and willpower; design your environment to make success easier; get back on track when you fall off course; ...and much more. Atomic Habits will reshape the way you think about progress and success, and give you the tools and strategies you need to transform your habits--whether you are a team looking to win a championship, an organization hoping to redefine an industry, or simply an individual who wishes to quit smoking, lose weight, reduce stress, or achieve any other goal.

Yes No Mohd Adip more_vert Flag inappropriate July 27, 2022 Favourite Quote : If you are having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn’t you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don’t want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. (Chapter 1) Favourite Chapter : Chapter 15 shares about how a couple wanted to develop a habit of not eating out. They labelled their savings account ‘Trip to Europe’ so whenever they decide to skip a meal outside, they put the amount of money that will be used for eating out into the ‘Trip to Europe’ account. This action creates awareness of how much money they can save from not eating out. The main point is that when we want to stop a bad habit. It should be rewarded with a tangible benefit that felt satisfying. Who should read it : This book is for those who always have a new resolution but always failed to achieve it. This book teaches us to develop small habits that can help us sustain what we want to achieve in our resolution. Did you find this helpful?
