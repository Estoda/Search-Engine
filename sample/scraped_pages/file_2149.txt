Play and learn as you watch the heart pump blood, where the food we eat passes or why a mosquito bite hurts us. With How does the Human Body Work? you can play and learn freely, with no pressure or stress. Play, observe, ask questions and find the answers. Have fun controlling your character, feeding him and cutting his nails. Enter our machine and watch how the blood platelets plug the wounds, how the muscles contract to kick a balloon or how a baby grows inside its mother. Learn about anatomy and concentrate on healthy habits, watch how the lungs get sick if we breathe a lot of smoke, how running and exercise is good for your health and how the human body is healthier and stronger if you eat a balanced diet. We only have one body, let's take care of it! This Human Body app for kids is full of science and stem education. Play and learn about biology and anatomy. Discover the human boy part names, bones, muscles and facts. With 9 incredible interactive scenes learning anatomy has never been easier: Circulatory system Zoom into the heart and see how it pumps blood. Discover white blood cells, platelets and red blood cells, and see how they work to make your body healthy. Respiratory System Watch your character inhale as see how the air goes to the lungs, bronchi and alveoli. Play by controlling your character and seeing how the rhythm of his breathing changes. Urogenital system Kids learn what the kidneys and bladder do. Interact with their character and help clean the blood and make him pee. Digestive system What path does the food follow from its entry into the human body until the waste comes out? Feed the character and help him absorb the nutrients and dispose of the waste. Nervous System Observe how the nerves of the whole body are activated and how the senses work: sight, smell, hearing... and also learn about the brain and its various parts. Skeletal System In this system, you'll learn the names of the bones and how the skeleton is made up of many bones, how they give us mobility and allow us to walk, jump, run... and how your bones are responsible for generating the blood of our body. Muscular System Learn how your body contracts and relaxes the muscles to help us move, protect us and learn the names of the most important muscles. You can turn your character around and see that we have other muscles on the other side! The Skin Discover how the skin protects us and how it responds to cold and heat. Watch how the hairs grow, clean the sweat of your character and play by cutting its nails and painting them. Pregnancy Take care of the pregnant woman, take her blood pressure, do an ultrasound and observe how a baby is forming inside her. This science and stem app is suitable for kids of all ages, starting at 4 years old, that are interested in anatomy and biology.

I don't get why people have to add subscriptions to get money when they have other ways to. I'm okay with subscriptions as long as they don't force you to buy it and if they make it time limited (like ixl). 15 people found this review helpful Did you find this helpful?

Other times, zoom locks up and I must switch organs to get zoom working again. But great job, this is really neat! 276 people found this review helpful Did you find this helpful?
